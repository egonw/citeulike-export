The discussion steered clear of typical {SiT} topics, such as rankings, perverse incentives in scientific publishing and the notion of the {PhD} 'factory'. Instead, it focused on the workload, the plight of young researchers, the capacity – or otherwise – of students to think critically, and who really sets the research agenda.},

'De verspreiding van kennis blijft achter bij de techniek', stelt de Maastrichtse onderzoeker Egon Willighagen, van origine chemicus maar overgestapt naar de bioinformatica.

Een tweede punt is dat er zo veel wordt gepubliceerd dat de kwaliteit van de peer review onder druk staat. Zeker voor multidisciplinaire publicaties vind je moeilijk peer reviewers die alle aspecten goed kunnen beoordelen. Via een preprintserver kunnen meer mensen ernaar kijken.'"},
